        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey, I'm Ismeria! I'm a 13 year old AuDHD (Autism + ADHD) programmer from Puerto Rico. My dad introduced me to coding during covid, and I got completely hooked. I've always been into tech, and learning to code inspired me to teach myself multiple other programming languages.</p>
        <p>I love working on projects like this website, Discord bots for servers, and even my own bot that could work across all servers. My main languages are Node.js, Java, and Python, and I code using VSCode. One of my proudest projects is Breinbot, a feature-rich bot built for a friend's server.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm usually studying languages, exploring different cultures, or playing chess.</p>
